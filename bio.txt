Builder / Maker / Thinker
        Franz is a constructor with a structured mind, grounded in precision and inspired by possibility. With a structured approach and a sharp,
        intuitive eye, he brings form to ideas, translating concepts into buildable realities. His craft is rooted in wood,<
        a material he understands deeply. From intricate toys to refined furniture and stairs, framing to full-scale interior and exterior finishes,
        he’s shaped nearly every form imaginable, working across construction sites and artisan workshops alike. Every project is a dialogue
        between function and form. Franz thrives in that space, where materials meet meaning, and structure supports creativity. His experience is
        hands-on, but also digital. With strong software skills in drafting and design tools, he’s able to bridge the tactile and the
        technical, ensuring designs are not only inspiring but executable.
        Good work speaks in both precision and quality, and Franz delivers that kind of work every day.
